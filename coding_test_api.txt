Hi ,

You have been provided with a zip containing an HTML to use as a starting point for building a small single page application. Extract the zip and open the HTML file.The HTML file sources jquery 1.7 and mockjax (a library used to mock ajax APIs). It also loads a fake API for getting information about a single type of resource - instances.
The API is quite simple, it only has two urls and does not accept extra parameters, /instances – this returns a json object with metadata about all instances /instances/id – this returns a json object with metadata for the specific instance with the given id The fake API has been given a 750ms latency.

The HTML file includes an example of how to use the API and send an AJAX request to it.

Solution requirements: For this test, we require you to extend the HTML file into a single page application that does the following:
* When the application loads, it loads data about all the instances from the API and visualizes this data in some way. (e.g: a table with all the data)
* The application must have some mechanism for refreshing the data of only a single record (e.g. A refresh record button)
* The application should show the user some indication that it is refreshing/loading new data

Send on whatever you have after 90 mins.

IMPORTANT! Put all your code into body of email, not as attachments as it may get stripped by our mail server.

Please let me know if you received my mail.

Best of luck,
Davide
